organisational thoughts on the structure of decenterland

decenterland is a private island inside of the ethereum virtual machine. For now, the decenterland economy is utilizing the Algorand chain. Work is being done at the spintrade project with Polygon and moonbeam to create cross chain asset exchange. The island of decenterland has a private system of value exchange. To become a member of decenterland requires holding of the decenterland ASA. The total supply of pioneer decenterland tokens is 210000. Holding 1 decenterland token entitles you to 1/210000 of the decenterland island storage space FOREVER. There will never be a renewal fee. Pioneers, in exchange for 1 Algo recieve LIFETIME membership and LIFETIME hosting/storage space on the private island of decenterland.crypto

decenterland.crypto believes in open source and transparent privacy for its' citizens. Thanks to the hard work, toils and several thousands of programming hours by active developers over the last 30 years privacy in decenterland has finally become reality.

As there are NO renewal fees there are also No refunds. However, decenterland tokens are exchangable should you wish to transfer your citizenship, private storage space and voting priviledge to another person. Decenterland, as a DAO, does recognize robots as citizens. Robots, providing they are not bad actors as defined by the community, are welcome to hold decenterland citizenship and / or vote in DAO elections.

Holding decenterland gives you priveledges that will escalate as the project expands. decenterland will be a DAO. Holding decenterland gives you the power of one vote. As decenterland matures and expands further pioneer bonus' will manifest.

If you are a developer or a keen pioneer send message to dcent@tuta.io

signup information coming soon.


note: decenterland is not decentraland. decenterland is a value storage system that is compatiable with decentraland. As an island of exchange, decenterland has teamed up with DAONOW, nftxchanges and spintrade.
