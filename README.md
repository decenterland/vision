organisational thoughts on the structure of dECENTERLAND

dECENTERLAND is the first of 12 projects being created by DAONOW. There will only ever be 13 tier one DAONOW tokens in existence with 1 DAONOW token representing 1 DAONOW in and of itself. 1 DAONOW token is being held to represents the organizational structure of decenterland aka dCENTERLAND aka decenterland.crypto

dECENTERLAND is a private island inside of the ethereum virtual machine. For now, the decenterland economy is utilizing the Algorand atomic swap chain. Work is being done at the spintrade project with Polygon and moonbeam to create cross chain asset exchange. The island of dECENTERLAND has a private system of value exchange. To become a member of decenterland requires holding of the decenterland ASA. The total supply of PIONEER dECENTERLAND tokens is 200000. Holding 1 decenterland token creates citizenship entitling you to 1/200000 of the entire decenterland island private storage space, 1/200000 FOREVER. There will never be a renewal fee for PIONEERS. PIONEERS, in exchange for 1 Algo recieve LIFETIME membership and LIFETIME private storage space on the private island of decenterland.crypto

in a sense, dCENTERLAND island can be conceptualized as an island of safety deposit boxes. 1 DCNTRL token represents 1 exchangable dCENTRALAND citizenship (aka membership) representing one virtual safety deposit box, one vote in the dCENTERLAND DAO FOREVER.

Provisions in the DAO stipulate that after all 200000 PIONEER citizenships enter circulation the island of decenterland.crypto will create a second tier of citizenship. Second tier citizen voting will not affect pioneer tier voting. Maximum rewards will be distributed to PIONEER citizens as grandfathered and grandmothered into the DAO itself. As explained above, your citizenship in decenterland will NEVER EXPIRE and can be value transfered like any other exchangable NFT asset.

decenterland.crypto believes in open source and transparent privacy for its' citizens. Thanks to the hard work, toils and several thousands of programming hours by active developers over the last 30 years privacy in decenterland has finally become reality.

As there are NO renewal fees in dCENTRALAND there are also No refunds in dCENTRALAND. However, dCENTRALAND tokens are exchangable should you wish to transfer your citizenship, private storage space and voting priviledge to another person. Decenterland, as a DAO, does recognize robots as citizens. Robots, providing they are not bad actors as defined by the community, are welcome to hold decenterland citizenship and / or vote in DAO elections.

Holding decenterland gives you privelidges that will escalate as the project expands. decenterland is a DAO. Holding decenterland gives you the power of one PIONEER vote. As decenterland matures and expands further PIONEER bonus priviledges will manifest as directed directly by PIONEER voting. Voting is not a mandatory requirement of recieving priviledge.

If you are a developer or a keen PIONNER send message to dcent@tuta.io with dECENTERLAND in the subject
signup information coming soon.


note: decenterland is not decentraland. decenterland is a value storage system that is compatiable with decentraland. As an island of exchange, decenterland has teamed up with DAONOW, nftxchanges and spintrade.
